# Webserver

The project is part of 1337 cursus. This is one of my favourite projects because I learned how HTTP protocol works, which is the protocol we use to send and receive requests from a server. I learned how HTTP requests and responses are structured and the HTTP methods and what each status codes mean.

The goal of the project is to create a webserver from scratch using only C sockets and C++. The first thing we had to do was to check for errors in the config file of our server, and whether its formated correctly. After that, when a request is sent to the server we had to take that request and check what the requester needs. We then send the requested file if it exists otherwise we send the appropriate error.
